# Random-Password-Generator

Hello, this is a Password Generator. It works by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to successfully giving a user a randmomized password that comprises of
letters, numbers, and symbols. This project involved a lot of google and trial and error but I am proud of what I have learned over the course of this 
assignment.
